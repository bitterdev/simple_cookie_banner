#Simple Cookie Banner

The Simple Cookie Banner add-on is the successor to the popular EU Cookie Law add-on, which was once in use on the former concrete5.org domain. This add-on provides a fully customizable solution for GDPR-compliant cookie management in Concrete CMS, significantly enhancing the capabilities of its predecessor. With precise configurability, it allows for the definition of categories, listing individual cookies, and holding tracking cookies until consent is given. Users can also easily modify their cookie settings at any time. Combining flexibility and user-friendliness, Simple Cookie Banner is the best choice for websites prioritizing transparency and legal compliance.
